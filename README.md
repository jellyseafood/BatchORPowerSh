# Batch and PowerShell Codes
Since most windows nowadays can run both Batch and PowerShell codes, I'd like to store some codes here.
These codes are only for the Windows OS.
I'd prefer to use batch codes as each cmd instance occupies only a signifcantly smaller memory compared to PowerShell.
PowerShell has several built-in features that cmd does not have. Specifically, I'd like to use PowerShell for:
  1. Credential Storage
  2. Greater than 32-bit arithmetic operations
  3. To evaluate performance of cmd functions due to its friendly get-date cmdlet
  4. The object-oriented beauty of it (and the way it manages variables)
